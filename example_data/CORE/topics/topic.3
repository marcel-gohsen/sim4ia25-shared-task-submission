Nursing and Schizophrenia Care

Documents discussing nursing approaches for schizophrenia spectrum and psychotic disorders, including diverse population needs, improvements in mental health services, and the impact of burnout on nursing staff.

Relevant documents should address strategies for providing effective nursing care to diverse populations with schizophrenia spectrum and psychotic disorders, ways to improve mental health services in nursing, or the effects of burnout on nurses managing these conditions. Documents that focus solely on schizophrenia without addressing nursing aspects are not relevant.
