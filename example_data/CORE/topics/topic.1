Role of Toxicologists in Collaboration with Safety Engineers

Documents discussing how toxicologists and safety engineers work together in assessing and mitigating risks.

Relevant documents should describe specific ways toxicologists and safety engineers collaborate, such as in workplace safety, regulatory compliance, or hazard assessments. Documents that discuss only one profession without reference to collaboration are not relevant.
